# Case Study on Including in Class Path in OS Environment

## Aim

The aim of this case study is to understand the process of including a package in the classpath of the operating system environment. This is crucial for Java developers to ensure that their compiled classes or JAR files are accessible to the Java runtime system.

## Introduction

In Java development, setting the classpath is essential for the Java runtime system to locate and load classes required by a Java application. This case study outlines the differences between the PATH and CLASSPATH environment variables and provides a step-by-step guide on how to include a package in the classpath.

### Differences between PATH and CLASSPATH

1. **PATH vs. CLASSPATH:**
    - The PATH variable is used by the operating system to locate "java" or "javac" commands for running Java programs and compiling Java source files.
    - The CLASSPATH variable is used to set the path for Java classes, specifying directories containing either .class files or JAR files required by the Java application.

2. **Setting PATH in Java:**
    - To set PATH in Java, the bin directory needs to be included in the PATH environment variable.

3. **Setting CLASSPATH in Java:**
    - To set CLASSPATH, include all directories where .class files or JAR files are located, which are required by the Java application.

4. **Usage:**
    - PATH is used by the operating system.
    - CLASSPATH is used by Java ClassLoaders to load class files.

5. **Scope:**
    - PATH refers to the system environment.
    - CLASSPATH refers to the development environment.

### Default Java Runtime System Behavior

By default, the Java runtime system uses the current working directory to locate classes.

### Setting Environmental Variable in Windows XP

#### Step 1: Open System Properties

- Right-click on "My Computer" on the desktop.
- Select "Properties."

#### Step 2: Access Advanced System Settings

- In the "System Properties" window, click on the "Advanced" tab.
- Click on the "Environment Variables" button.

#### Step 3: Add New System Variable

- In the "Environment Variables" window, click on "New" in the "System variables" section.

#### Step 4: Define New System Variable

- Set the variable name as "PATH" and the variable value as "c:\Program Files\java\jdk1.5.0_10\bin;"

#### Step 5: Confirm Changes

- Click "OK" to save the changes.

These steps ensure that the Java runtime system can locate the necessary Java commands for compilation and execution.

## Conclusion

Including a package in the classpath is a crucial step for Java developers to ensure that their classes or JAR files are accessible to the Java runtime system. Understanding the differences between PATH and CLASSPATH and following the steps to set environmental variables in the operating system provides a foundation for seamless Java development.
